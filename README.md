# VU evolving landscapes

VU evolving landscapes is a collection of notebooks providing an introduction to landscape evolution modeling. 
Part of this material is based on the [CSDMS Ivy collection][csdms-ivy] that is written and maintained by the 
[Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System ](https://csdms.colorado.edu)(CSDMS).

## Lessons

1. [Project Jupyter][jupyter]
1. [Introduction to the Shell][shell]
