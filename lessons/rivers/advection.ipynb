    "\n",
    "The advection PDE Eq. $\\ref{eq:1}$ above is a prototype of an **initial value problem**: The solution is obtained by using the known initial values and marching or advancing in time. The solution of this equation can be obtained directly from the initial conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z(x,t) = z(x-vt,0) \\label{eq:2}\\tag{2}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/Stencil1.png\" style=\"width:3in;height:1in\" />\n",

    "<img src=\"./media/Stencil2.png\" style=\"width:3in;height:1.25in\" />\n",

    "If $v$ is positive, than the direction of the advected flow is from left to right along the $x$ axis. To capture such a positive flow, the upwind discretisation scheme uses the info from the neighboring node in the upwind direction, that is, the node to the left, indicated by $j-1$ on the sketch. In this case the the Finite Difference Equation (FDE) of Eq. $\\ref{eq:1}$ can be written as:\n",

    "\\frac{\\tilde{z}_{j+1}^n - \\tilde{z}_j^n}{\\Delta x} = 0\n",

    "To obtain this equation, we have taken discrete values for $x$ and $t$: $x_j=j\\Delta x$, $t_n = n \\Delta t$. The solution of the finite difference equation is also defined at the discrete points ($j\\Delta x$,$n \\Delta t$): $\\tilde{z}_j^n=\\tilde{z}(j\\Delta x,n \\Delta t)$. Note that we used $z$ to denote the solution of the PDE\n",
