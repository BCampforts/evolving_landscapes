Note that general-style knickpoint retreat is well casted with an advection equation but that specific processes causing waterfalls to retreat (such as plunge pool erosion) are not represented. If you want to learn more on the Niagara escarpment, check out [this webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Az7utk0h3Ek). "

Advance the knickpoint in time using the numerical advection solver as developed in the [advection notebook](advection.ipynb). You can assume an average wave speed, or knickpoint retreat rate, of 1m/year and run the solution for 10000 years. The outlet of the channel (boundary condition on the right) can be set and fixed to zero throughout the run. Note that the incision wave is running from right to left. What sign is the velocity?"
