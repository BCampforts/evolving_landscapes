    "Niagara falls are advecting over a relatively short river segment where discharge can be considered constant. This is not the case for all rivers where discharge typically increases as a power function of distance downstream. \n",
    "Create a new longitudinal river profile. This time, make the river 100km long and 75m high, except for the outlet of the river (last node of array) which is the boundary condition and can be fixed to 0. \n",

    "where $K$ is an erodibility coefficient with dimensions of $[L^{(1-2m)}/T]$. $K$ is thought to be positively correlated with climate wetness, or storminess (this is hard to quantify) and to be negatively correlated with rock strength (again, rock strength is hard to quantify). $A$ is drainage area and $S$ is the slope.  The erosion function has dimensions of erosion (lowering) rate, [L/T]. The expression is also known as the \"stream power law\" because the exponents can be configured to represent an erosion law that depends on stream power per unit bed area (Whipple & Tucker, 1999). A common choice of exponents is $m=1/2$, $n=1$, but other combinations are possible depending on one's assumptions about process, hydrology, channel geometry, and other factors (e.g., Howard et al., 1994; Whipple et al., 2000).\n",
