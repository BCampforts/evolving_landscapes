    "You will now solve the diffusion equation and write a code that allows us to solve this equation. The change in concentration will be calculated over a distance $Lx$. There are two ways to do this, we can either calculate the second derivative directly (i.e. the curvature), or do it in two steps by calculating the flux (i.e. the first derivative of the concentration) and then the derivative of the flux. We will use the second method because it is easier to calculate a first derivative than a second derivative.\n",

Finally, you will have to choose a time step that is small enough. The [Von Neumann stability analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_stability_analysis) prescribes that $\\Delta t$ must be smaller than $\\frac{\\Delta X^2}{2D}$. \n",
